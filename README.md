# A Fun Madlibs Game using Python 
This is fun Mablib game generated using python. There are three mini stories to select from and the input from the users results in a hilarious read!
I have used Visual Basic Studio to write the code in. 
For my detailed journey into writing the code for this Game, please read my Medium Article: 
Happy Libbing..I mean Madlibing!
